# Representativeness Analysis

- Purpose: To show how our data can be representative of real job market
- Itâ€™s difficult:
    - There is no ground truth
    - Data is always biased
    - However, we can compare our data with the Bureau of Labor Statistics data
- Occupational Employment Statistics (OES)
    - Produces employment and wage estimates annually for over 800 occupations
    - These estimates are available for the nation as a whole, individual States, and metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas
    - OES does not contain job vacancy data!
